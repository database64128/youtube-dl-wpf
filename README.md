## Usage

1. Download the pre-built binary or build it from source.
2. Download [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) or [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl).
3. It's optional but highly recommended to also download [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html). Otherwise you won't be able to merge separate video and audio tracks.
4. The framework-dependent binary requires an installed [.NET Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) to run. Alternatively, download the self-contained binary that bundles the runtime.
5. Run `youtube-dl-wpf.exe`. Go to __Settings__. Set the path to youtube-dl/yt-dlp and FFmpeg.
6. Go back to the home tab. Paste a video URL and start downloading! ðŸš€

## FAQ

1.  Q: The __Download__ button is grayed out and I can't click it!

    A: `youtube-dl-wpf` is a simple GUI wrapper. It doesn't bundle any downloader with it. You have to download youtube-dl or yt-dlp for it to work. FFmpeg is required by youtube-dl and yt-dlp when merging separate video and audio tracks, which is the case for most formats on YouTube.

2.  Q: How can I use a proxy to download?

    A: Leave the proxy field empty to use system proxy settings. Otherwise the format is similar to how `curl` accepts proxy strings (e.g. `socks5://localhost:1080/`, `http://localhost:8080/`). Currently the upstream doesn't accept `socks5h` protocol and treat `socks5` as `socks5h` by always resolving the hostname using the proxy. This is tracked in [this issue](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/issues/22618).

3.  Q: Downloading the whole playlist doesn't work!

    A: It's an upstream bug, just like many other issues you might discover. There's nothing I can do. Just report the bug to yt-dlp or youtube-dl, whichever you use.

4.  Q: `youtube-dl` and `yt-dlp` behave differently!

    A: In some cases, yes, and `youtube-dl-wpf` tries to align their behavior by sending different options and arguments for different backends. See the [backends documentation](Backends.md) for more information.
